- [Manipulating Text Data](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/10_text_data.html)


1. Update your Raspberry Pi's local course repository ([instructions here](../references/Tips_and_Tricks.md#updating-local-course-repository-from-github))
1. Copy Lab 5 notebook file to your workspace
    ```
    cp /home/pi/seneca-prg550-2022-spring/labs/Lab06-Jupyter-and-Pandas.ipynb /home/pi/workspace/labs/
    ```
1. Start Jupyter notebook from the `workspace` directory 
1. Navigate to the `labs` directory and open the `Lab06-Jupyter-and-Pandas.ipynb` notebook
1. Follow instructions in the Lab 5 notebook

Tip: open the tutorial links from your PC's browser to reduce memory usage by the Pi
